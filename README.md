# MATLAB_social_network_analysis
Basic Matlab scripts for social network analysis (part of these script have been used in university project to analyze a multi energy system).

## Metrics
A list of calculated metrics through scripts:
* Betweenness centrality.
* Hub and authority scores.
* Diameter and distances evaluation.
* Global and local assortativity.
* Closeness.
* HCU-rank score for importance ranking.

## Previews
These are some graphs that you can obtain through the scripts or small variation of them.
